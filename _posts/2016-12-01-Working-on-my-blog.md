**Working on my blog**

This lesson we got to do what we wanted so i chose to work on my blog as it wasn't the most impressive blog out of the class. So i started by upgrading the background which wasnâ€™t the most of easy task but i asked a few people to help and it worked. It took half an hour to complete but it look amazing i had a multicolor design which it really unique and so out there that it was different from all the rest of the other blogs.

I also changed my avatar which used to be an angry man with a beard looking at you, which i thought was a bit creepy so i changed it to an optical illusion that was a black and white twirly circle that you would use to hypnotize people which i found by looking up moving images and i found this and i thought it was really fun so i chose it!

Next i updated my blogs but i had trouble posting them so i asked my friend and they helped me with it. 

I think that this lesson was really helpful!
