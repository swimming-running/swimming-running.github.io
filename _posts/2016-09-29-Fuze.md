**FUZE**

**Today we found it difficult because it's our first time using this website and it was interesting and very stressful on one of our projects we had to restart three times because we tried to save our work and it didn't really work out. We saved it over the previous work so we lost that and then we try to get it back but then we lost the pat work to but we redid it and everything was fine.**

**EBI**

**I think that if I read the booklet more carefully we would never have had that problem. Also I think if I brought the in my USB I could have saved it but I need to restart it next lesson.**

**WWW**

** I think that what went well was how my and my partner didn't make a fuss trying to sort out we just got on with it. I think this was a great lesson and next lesson will hopefully be better**
