**First blog of year nine**

For the past few weeks we have been working on our coding skills which i think will really help me in this year of IT. i will go through what we learnt in each lesson and how it will help me in the future:

Lesson 1:

This week was our introduction to coding but first we went through how to be a good student which i believe was indication to all classes and not just IT. we went through how to act in the lessons and how the teachers mark us about our attitude in class and how much we participate in class as well.

(Sadly we missed lesson 2 because of our whole school photograph)

Lesson 3:

This lesson we had to catch up with the other classes as we had missed a lesson and my teacher said we had which was really good., we learnt so much in that lesson we went from an empty spreadsheet to a spreadsheet filled with amazing coding which a week before i would have no clue what it meant.

Lesson 4: 

This lesson i had already done most of the work by half way through the lesson so i helped other people with their work which i think benefited them because they didn't understand it before, but also me as by teaching it to other people some how it taught me aswell.
