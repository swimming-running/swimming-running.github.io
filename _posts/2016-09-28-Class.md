**THE LESSON**

**In today's lesson i think I worked with my partner really well we were laughing because of the amount of times we had to restart because in this programming lesson if you made a mistake the computer didn't let you change it. it would only let you type in I wouldn't let you delete but we worked around it. We worked like this: I would type in the programming while he would read it out but then halfway through the lesson we would switch and he would type and I would read it out. Unfortunately I don't think we accomplished our goals from last weeks lesson but that means we just have to give it another go.**

**EBI:**

**I think we worked well as a team and we  challenged ourselves by moving onto the next level which was challenging but we did it.**

**WWW:**

**I think we need to work on last lessons task**
