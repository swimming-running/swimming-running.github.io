**Making my blog perfect **

**This lesson i spent it all trying to make my blog the best it could be because i missed a lesson because i was ill for two days and was a bit behind with my blog posting and my blog looking nice and unique.**

** **

**The whole lesson i tried to make my blog look unique as i didn't want it to be the same as everyone else's i because then it wouldn't stand out i wanted mine to stand out so it could be noticed. I think i worked hard on making my background better and i also helped people with their blog because they had similar problems that i had overcome in my time using this blog. Also people would help me with my blog to wih was really helpful as i had had a lot of problems with my blog but they showed my how to do it.**

**I found this lesson helpful as i had a lot of problems with my blog but now i don't !!!**
