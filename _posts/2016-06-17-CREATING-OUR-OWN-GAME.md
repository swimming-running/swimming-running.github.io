**CREATING OUR OWN GAME**

**Last lesson we started to create our own game this is my idea:**

**Name of Game: **A and B memory game

**Purpose of game: **The purpose of the game is to remember the pattern of A's and B’s that the Microbit will read out. And then there will be a countdown of 10 seconds. After the countdown the Microbit will ask you to click the A and B buttons on the micro bit, if you get it correct it will show a smiley face but if you get it wrong nothing will happen. This will repeat 5 times but different patterns. This will improve your memory skills.

**Number of players: **1 or more weather if you want to take turns or if you want to see how many you get correct out of 5.

**Inputs:** Microbit say "ABBAAABAB". If A is pressed, If B is pressed, If B is pressed…… Microbit draw (smiley face).

**Processes **the program will calculate: Say "ABBAAABAB". When A is pressed, When B is pressed, When B is pressed…… draw (smiley face).

**Outputs: **The micro bit will say "ABBAAABAB". If you press down the correct buttons then the Microbit will draw a smiley face.

**Me and my best friend were working together so it was a partner ship.**

**EBI: **

**I think it could have gone better if we agreed on the game More sufficiently because it took a while to decide on the game which wasted a lot of time.**

**WWW:**

**I think once me and my friend had figured out what we were going to do for the game, it was a quick process. **
