**Sorting hat**

**Last lesson we tried to do some challenges with the micro bit.**

**Firstly we watched the Harry Potter clip of the sorting hat**

**And we got the idea of weather we should make a sorting**

**Hat on the microbit. We made a code to randomly choose **

**The harry potter houses; Griffindor, Slytherin, **

**Hufflepuff and Ravencla****w.**![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/flI8hRdTG8ON5X6I6W7xFg_img_0.jpg)** **

**Then we said that we should make the sorting hat but for our school houses; Holman, Newman, Pearson, Rayner and **

**Thorne. So we played against each other and saw what **

**Houses the sorting microbit will put us in.**

**Last lesson was really fun and i hope we could do more **

**Lessons like that one.**
