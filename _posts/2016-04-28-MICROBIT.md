**MICROBIT**

**Last lesson we used a thing called**** ****_a microbit_****. We haven't got them yet, we donâ€™t why but it sounds really fun.**

**Instead of using the actual thing we used a simulation of it. We used the website ****_[www.Microbit.co_**m](http://www.microbit.com)**, it was really fun and we made the microbit do anything we like, like make it into a dice and it selects random numbers like a dice. **

**I also made it into a 'true or false' quiz. I aksed questions and then i would press on true or false. If the person gets the question wrong then it would make a and face and if you get it correct it makes a happy face **
