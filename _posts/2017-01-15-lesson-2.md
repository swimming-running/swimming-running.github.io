    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
    <td>We watched a video of a japanese school boy who had to vult a tall box in front of his class. He missed and missed but tried and tried and finally he got it. I felt that this video was really inspirational as he didn't give up or he didn't even hesitate or think about stopping. I thought that this video was very effective to my learning as i haven't forgotten it.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was how i was sitting in a position in which was hard to see the board and i had to lean over to see.



</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
    <td>I think i didn't answer any of the questions that my teacher asked so next week i will put my hand up more and i will ask questions that i can't answer myself.</td>
