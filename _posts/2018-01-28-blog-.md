**Run Length Encoding **

I found today's lesson really interesting and fun as it was a one of topic which i has never heard of before, and because i hadn't heard of it before it was really interesting to learn about.

Run length coding is a way of making an image or picture smaller in size and take up less space by typing the colors and the amount of the colors. For example if i had in a horizontal line four red blocks, two blue blocks and four red block, that would take up ten blocks across:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>……..</td>
    <td>……..</td>
    <td>……..</td>
    <td>……..</td>
    <td>……..</td>
    <td>……..</td>
    <td>……...</td>
    <td>……...</td>
    <td>……...</td>
    <td>……...</td>
  </tr>
</table>


 However if I run length code it then i would only take up six blocks:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>R</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>R</td>
  </tr>
</table>


In class we had to make a picture using google heets which was quite challenging as you had to use squares to make the image. But my image was a smilie face made from lots of different colors such as green blue and red. My drawing was 180 squares but my run length coding was only 74 which was a 58.8% decrease of my drawing which is a lot smaller.
