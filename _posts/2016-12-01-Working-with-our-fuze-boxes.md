**Working with our fuze boxes**

**Last lesson we used our fuze boxes again it was so fun as we created a game which was really hard. The computer would read out "try and guess my number, between 1 and 100" then “you have ten guesses” So we had 10 guesses to guess a random number between 1 and 100, sounds simple. **

**It was so hard if you guessed 50 at the start it would say whether higher or lower and so on. But still to get the exact number that the computer pick so it was really hard.**

**Then we created another game which we had to enter our name and age and it would say if you are young or old it was so good as it said i was young but when i typed in the number "100000000000000000000000" it said i was old and i found it quite funny not that anyone else did.**

**I think it was another great lesson that I had learnt a lot from it.**
