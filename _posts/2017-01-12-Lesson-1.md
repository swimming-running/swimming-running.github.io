**Lesson 1**

**Today we looked at binary and we learnt how to create numbers using binary. Our teacher gave us 6 questions that we had to solve and convert from binary to base 10. **

**We look how PSY broke YouTube with his gangnamstyle music video, he got 2.7 billion views. We watch a really interesting video from which I learnt a lot of interesting facts about storage and memory.**

**Then we watched his music video, personally i found it a bit odd as it was so random but some parts were funny. I guess that's why he got 2.7 billion views?**

**We learnt tricks that were really useful and sped up the course of working out numbers of binary.**

**This lesson was really useful and I learnt a lot from it.**
