Getting our microbits

**Last lesson our microbits were delivered to our school and it was mammothly exhilarating as I had never seen anything like it before.  **

**It works like this: you go on to the microbit website and follow one of the tutorials or if you feel creative enough you can create your own game. After you need to make sure you save it otherwise it will be a total waste. After that you need to plug in your microbit to the computer and your game will show up on the micro bit, it's so cool. **
