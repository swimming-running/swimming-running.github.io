**Code Academy** 

**Target:** 

to use code academy to understand more about coding

**Did I reach my target**: 

Yes, as i completed all that we were supposed to do.

**How did I learn?:**

During this lesson when i used code academy i read all the instructions and i made sure i knew what is was doing before i started to try, if i tried and it didn't work out i would read what had gone wrong and i would view my code and try to change it. Also if i got stuck i would not ask the person next to me straight away i would try to fix it before, and if i had tried everything i could think of, would then ask the person next to me.

**What limited my learning?:**

I think i did get distracted a lot because once i got stuck and asked the person next to me i would start to say a whole conversation. Also sometimes i wouldn't read the whole of the explanation on how to complete the task because sometimes it looked quite easy so didn’t need to read but then i didn’t really understand it.

**What could I do next time?:**

Next time i will make sure to read all the instructions before i answer so that i will know how to do it in the future.
