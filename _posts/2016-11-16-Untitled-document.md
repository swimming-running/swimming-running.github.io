**Lesson**

**Today we carried on with our projects. It was really not a great**** ****as my computer wasn't working so we had to switch around to and from around 4 computers till we got one that worked but it was a good lesson because there must have been something wrong with the plug.**

**It was quite annoying because we only got around 10 minutes of work done because i had to go to a music lesson half way through the lesson so i hadn't had as much completed as i hoped for but you can't do much about that.**

**In the 10 minutes i was there we got quite a lot done we completed a whole section because we tried to hurry through it. Hopefully next lesson will be better.**
