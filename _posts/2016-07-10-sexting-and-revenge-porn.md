**Sexting and revenge porn**

**Last lesson we were talking about sexting and porn. To start of the lesson we were understanding the difference between them because they are quite similar. Sexting is when you send a person a picture of your private parts or you without any cloths on. Revenge porn is when you have a picture of someone and you blackmail them to do things that they don't want to do. **

**We were also talking about events in school were this had been happening or how it had happened to us.**

**Now i know the difference of revenge porn and sexting i also know how much it can affect your life if one of your pictures got out on the world wide web or people you know had seen it.**

**If it does happen to you you should go and speak to a friend or tell someone who you know can fix it but if it gets too out of hand you should go and see the police.**
