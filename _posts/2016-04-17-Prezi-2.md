**Prezi Lesson**

Last lesson we handed in our assignments of our Easter holiday project. Our project was to create a prezi which was about the history of computers.

We did it about:

Steve Jobs and Apple.

Charles Babbage and his Difference and Analytical engines.

Pascal

Bill Gates and Microsoft

Alan Turing and Colossus/Bletchley Park.

Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer.

Admiral Grace Hopper and debugging

Blaise Pascal

George Boole

Tim Berners Lee

The Pocket Calculator.

Then we wrote all about them which was really interesting for me because I had never learnt anything about them when i was in my old school.

This is my one:
