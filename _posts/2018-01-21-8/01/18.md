<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What I found difficult</td>
    <td>this lesson i didn't find things difficult because the teacher explained things step by step. Once we learnt a thing that we didn't know before he let is go back to the computer, go to rep.it and practice the skill.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what I could have done better</td>
    <td>when I was by my computer trying the new skill there were a few things i found a bit challenging so I asked my partner for the answer. However instead I should have asked him if he would be able to help me then i could have been able to do it next time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what I will do next time </td>
    <td>next time if I find something difficult i will ask my friend ro explain it to me or if he doesn't know aswell i will ask the teacher</td>
