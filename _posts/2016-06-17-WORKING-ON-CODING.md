**WORKING ON CODING #2**

**Last lesson we carried on to work on different small coding **

**projects . There are nine in total and I did three last lesson: Roll the dice, Flash point and Mood swings. And I did three this lesson: Worst snake ever, Quick-finger and Maze Runner.**

**WWW: **

**I think that what went well was how fast and smoothly i went through the codes. I went a lot faster than i did last lesson so i improved a lot which is a good thing!!!**

**EBI:**

**This leson i think i did all i could to have no EBI but there is always one thing, i still get distracted by my friends. I need to stop it !!!**
