**WORKING ON CODING **

**Last lesson we started to work on different small coding**

**projects . There are nine in total and I did three this lesson: Roll the dice, Flash point and Mood swings. They were all a challenge but I got through them.**

**WWW:**

**I think that what went well was how fast and smoothly i went through the codes. I worked a lot faster than most of my class.**

**EBI:**

**I think i need to try and stay focused and try to concentrate more as i could have worked twice as fast.**
