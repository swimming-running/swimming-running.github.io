**WORKING ON CODING**

**Last lesson we started to work on different small coding **

**project . There are nine in total and I did three today: Roll the dice, Flash point and Mood swings. These were all a challenge but on a whole I think I did good.**

**We used a guide to help us with the coding steps. It was called Code-Kingdom. It was really helpful and it helped me get through the coding projects.**

**WWW: **

**I think that what went well was how fast and smoothly i went through the codes. I finished them before most of the people in my class so i think i did pretty well.**

**EBI:**

**I think that I need to work on keeping focused and not getting distracted so easily. I could have goo twice as fast as I had gone.**

**I will try and work on that next lesson!!! **
